# DRAO [Fall 2022]

This quarter, I switched gears from working with GASKAP-HI data to continuing an investigation piloted by one of Gilles’s previous students, 
which involved DRAO HI and IR emission data. My research this quarter probed the following:
1) whether the HI—from many various regions—has a kinematic signature related to molecular formation; is kinematic HI associated with the H2?
2) whether differences between the distribution of excess IR emission in various regions is dependent on the evolutionary stage of the molecular gas

To begin, I read some introductory papers sent along by Gilles and Kirill (eg: Barriault et al 2010), and obtained the local/intermediate 
HI column density maps, local IR maps, and possible H2 absorption line data (from Wakker) for these regions of the sky. There were 14 HI regions in total. 
Unfortunately, none of Wakker’s H2 absorption lines coincided with the DRAO regions.

I first plotted the local/intermediate HI column density maps alongside the local IR maps for a first look

In my attempt to map the IR excess, for each HI region, I plotted the ratio of IR to combined local/intermediate HI column densities. 
(Unfortunately this did not prove to be very useful, but it was an interesting intermediary step!)

However, a more genuine look at the excess IR came from working by eye: I plotted IR values against the local HI column densities and estimated a line 
of best fit; then using this line, I plotted the expected IR and excess IR (by subtracting the expected IR values from Gilles’s given IR map and 
denoising the data). I repeated the same process for the intermediate HI column densities. We hypothesized that the excess IR should be proportional to 
the molecular gas, and therefore kinematic HI behavior related to IR excess should be related to the molecular gas.

Using the excess IR maps, I plotted excess IR contours atop the local HI column density maps.

Around this time, I obtained HI 3D cubes from Gilles and began creating 1st and 2nd moment maps. They appeared odd on the macroscopic scale—even 
after restricting the velocity range and thresholding—and we never fully fixed this issue, but theorized it could relate to the spectral resolution of 
the HI cubes.

My last task of the quarter was creating HI RGB color maps by finding the dominating velocity ranges with HI emission and binning them into 3, with each 
bin (in order of decreasing velocity) plotted as red, green, and blue. The goal here was to see if we noticed any interesting HI kinematics. 

Overall, this quarter I’ve learned much about the logistics of switching projects, and of applying a specialized database of knowledge to a somewhat 
similar yet different project. The DRAO project is inherently similar to my GASKAP work, but still required me to glean new information about the HI 
regions I investigated, IR emission, DRAO baselines, etc. I’ve greatly improved my widespread understanding of the ISM.

By analyzing the excess IR emission and possible HI gas kinematics, my research provides the foundation for us to compare DRAO data with that of GASKAP, 
allowing us to establish whether there is actually an evolutionary scenario with the molecular gas involved.
